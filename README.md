# Project Goal
This project try to present how to cluster customers and help company to make special discount for different targets. 
In order to gain profits, company should set different coupon for different customers because every customers are individual and unique. However, customizing everyone is difficult
to reach so we can create some clusters to divide whole customers. We separate people into same group with similar traits so that we can satisfy most of people
with implementing strategies for different clusters.

# Method
I use K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to demonstrate.  
At first, I plot scatters to understand each variables correlation. We can see that gender doesn't have any relation to segmenting customers, so I drop it.  


- Kmeans  
- Hierarchical Clustering  

# Conclusion



# Resource
Data is from Kaggle: Popular Unsupervised Clustering Algorithms
